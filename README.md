# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal in this project was to strengthen my understanding of the C++ programming language by building a functional, organized, and maintainable application. This project allowed me to practice modern C++ syntax, implement clean structure using header/source separation, and apply core programming concepts such as functions, data structures, object-oriented design, and input/output handling.

The software I created is a simple C++ console application designed to demonstrate essential C++ features. It includes organized modules, a clean directory structure, header files, reusable functions, and practical examples of language fundamentals. The project showcases the use of variables, functions, classes, loops, conditionals, vectors, namespaces, and basic architecture.

My purpose in writing this software was to deepen my hands-on experience with C++ syntax, project structure, header file usage, compilation processes, and general best practices for building modular applications. This project also serves as a solid foundation for expanding into more advanced C++ development.

# Future Work


- Add more advanced C++ modules (templates, file I/O, threading)
- Improve user interface features and extend program capabilities
- Implement robust error handling and input validation
- Add unit tests for functions and classes
- Migrate project to a full CMake-managed build system
